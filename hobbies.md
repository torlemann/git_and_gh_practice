I don't really have enough hobbies right now. I used to paint, and
I started to learn how to make stained glass art, and I would like
to get back to that. Lately I have been watching a lot of movies
and shows. I also volunteer a lot, working with raptors. I volunteer
weekly at a bird rescue center as a raptor rehab handler, and also
seasonally with a science group that bands migrating raptors.
