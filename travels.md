My favorite travel experiences have been to Europe. I've been a few
times. My first trip was to Spain, Paris, and Berlin. The next time
was to France, London, Berlin, Prague, and Switzerland. The most
recent time was to Italy, France, and Switzerland. I can't wait to
go back! I would also love to visit Central and South America, hopefully
Mexico next year! I want to see the "River of Raptors" in Vera Cruz.
