This is a nebulous subject for me. I suppose I am motivated by
change. A desire for change. I want to add value to my life by
trying a new field/industry, learning something new and getting good
at it, creating something useful for causes that I care about, having
more flexibility in my schedule and working remotely, and making more
money.
