This is a nebulous subject for me. I have struggled with motivation
for a long time.
I suppose I am motivated by a desire for change. I want to add value
to my life by trying a new field/industry, learning something new and
getting good at it, creating something useful for causes that I care
about, having more flexibility in my schedule and working remotely,
and making more money.
